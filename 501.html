    <p style="color: #AD7DD5; font-size: 150%;">1)Choose one of the data sets listed above in the Activity section or one that you find on your own and give a brief description of it. What specifically were the types of data (text, sounds, transactions, etc.) included in the data set you chose?</p>

    <p style="font-size: 110%;">&nbsp;I choose a data set of student debts above.This is a graph that x-axis is cost of tuition and fees,y-axis is debt at graduation, and you can change the data of year, to change it's values.It have 2 different color for public school and private school to present where the values come from. </p>
    
    <p style="color: #AD7DD5; font-size: 150%;">2)What new facts did you learn when exploring the data set? List at least 3 facts.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 110%;"> 1)The values is keep going to right when the year increase,which mean the tuition and fees is increase. <br> 2)Private school values are going a lot futher than private school values to top and right,which mean cost of tuition and fees and debt at graduation is a lot higher.<br>3)The private school values are close together,which mean the student debts is close,and private school values are going around the whole graph,which mean the student debts is very different for different private school. </p>
    <p style="color: #AD7DD5; font-size: 150%;">3)Write a question you have about the data set you chose. Now, convert that question into a hypothesis (a statement) with your prediction about the data.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 110%;">&nbsp;Is the average student debt from private school higher than public school?<br>If most of the private school values is getting a higher number on x&y values than public school,then private school debts must higher than public school.</p>
    <p style="color: #AD7DD5; font-size: 150%;">4)Identify at least one security and/or privacy concern that is associated with the data in the data set you chose?</p>

    <p style="font-size: 110%;">&nbsp;The privacy concern that is associated with the data in the data set I chose is that I tell you the costs of debt from public school and private school.
    </p>
    
        <p style="color: #AD7DD5; font-size: 150%;">5)If your data set included a visualization, explain the purpose of the visualization. How would you change or improve the visualization? If it did not include a visualization, describe one that you think would be useful in understanding the data.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 110%;">&nbsp; The purpose of visualization is to make it easier to look through.I would change it to a pie of average debt of private school values and public school values, so the visualization wouldn't have too many values to look through.
